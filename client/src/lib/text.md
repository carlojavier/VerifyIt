### What.

It is no secret that the spread of false information - widely defined as "Fake News - is among the growing, modern challenges we face as a collective society. Yet a greater issue lies underneath the veil of Fake News: complacency.  

Verify Itâ„¢ is a full-stack web application built to help rejuvenate our collective curiosities. We aim to cultivate a well-informed society by providing a platform where users can annotate, discuss, and verify news stories from all over the Internet. We amplify our program by juxtaposing user-generated content with FakeBox - MachineBox's innovative fake news detector, which not only identifies fake news domains, but also utilizes a machine learning algorithm to identify whether titles and contents are biased or impartial.
